# Numerical Linear Algebra

This repository contains the slides and Jupyter Notebook used for AMS 526 - Numerical Linear Algebra at Stony Brook University, taught by Prof. Xiangmin Jiao over several years.

To use the Jupyter Notebooks, you need to setup some software, which is relatively simple and painless:
 1. Install Jupyter Nootbook for Octave by following the instructions [here](../../wiki/Setup-Jupyter-Notebook-for-Octave)
 2. For proper rendering of LaTeX equations and theorems in the Jupyter Notebook, install `jupyter_latex_envs` by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/numgeom/fenics-notes/wiki/Useful-Addons-for-Jupyter-Notebook#latex-environments-jupyter_latex_envs).
