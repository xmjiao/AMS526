# Numerical Linear Algebra

This repository contains the slides and Jupyter Notebook used for AMS 526 - Numerical Linear Algebra at Stony Brook University, taught by Prof. Xiangmin Jiao over several years.

In this class, we will use [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) for the lecture notes and use [GNU Octave](http://octave.org) to implement the algorithms. One easy way to use the Notebooks is to render them directly in Github and then copy-and-paste the statements into MATLAB to run. However, it may be much more convenient if you install Jupyter Notebook and set it up to work with Octave. You can set them up by following the steps below:
 1. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/numgeom/notes/wiki/Installation-Guides-for-Jupyter-Notebooks#octave-kernel-for-jupyter-notebook) to install Jupyter Notebook and Octave Kernel.
 2. Following the instructions [here](https://github.com/numgeom/notes/wiki/Installation-Guides-for-Jupyter-Notebooks#octave-kernel-for-jupyter-notebook) to install `latex_envs` for Jupyter Notebook, which is needed for proper rendering of LaTeX equations and theorems.
